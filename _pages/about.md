Welcome to my website! I'm Diego, a 3rd year PhD candidate studying neuroscience at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I research the neurobiological mechanisms behind the incubation of craving for stimulants and sucrose in a rat model with a focus on the role of dopamine receptors within the medial prefrontal cortex in the phenomenon. 

My journey
======
I was the first in my family to graduate high school and I was lucky enough to have a mentor in high school that encouraged me to apply to attend college. I began my undergraduate studies at the California State University of Los Angeles before transferring to the University of California, Irvine and graduating with a B.A. in Psychology in 2015.
