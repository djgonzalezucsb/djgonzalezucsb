Welcome to my website! I'm Diego, a 3rd year PhD candidate studying neuroscience at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I research the neurobiological mechanisms behind the incubation of craving for stimulants and sucrose in a rat model with a focus on the role of dopamine receptors within the medial prefrontal cortex in the phenomenon. 

My journey
======
I was the first in my family to graduate high school and I was lucky enough to have a mentor in high school that encouraged me to apply to attend college. I began my undergraduate studies at the California State University of Los Angeles before transferring to the University of California, Irvine and graduating with a B.A. in Psychology in 2015. While I originally wanted to pursue a career in counseling, I realized that neurobiological research aligned more with my values and decided to pursue a career as a researcher instead.
As a first-generation college student with limited academic support, I applied and was rejected by PhD programs for three consecutive years due to my lack of research experience at the time. I finally decided to apply to master's programs in my fourth year of applying to graduate programs and was finally accepted into the master's program in experimental psychology at the California State University of San Bernadino. I gained valuable research experience during my three years there investigating the neurobiological mechanisms of drugs of abuse-related phenomena before I tried applying to PhD programs once more and was fortunate enough to get accepted into the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2021 where I now currently reside and study neurobiological mechanisms of addiction in a rat model.
